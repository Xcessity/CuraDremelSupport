# CuraDremelSupport
This project aims to create a configuration set that supports the Dremel 3D printers in the newest Cura releases.

Cura target version: 4.8.0

Printers: Dremel 3D45

What's working so far:
- Cura lists the Dremel3D45 as available (definition copied from Dremel Digilab Slicer)
- The 3D model of the build platform is shown on build volume
- Dremel materials can be selected from the material browser (PLA, ECO-ABS, Nylon, PETG)
- The default material is set to the Dremel ECO-ABS when adding a new printer

What's missing:
- The quality profiles for the specific material are missing.
